Here, we provide the MATLAB code for computing wave-breaking statistics based on Methods developed by [Kliess and Melville (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1175/2010JTECHO744.1) and the seminal work of [O.M. Phillips (1986)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/spectral-and-statistical-properties-of-the-equilibrium-range-in-windgenerated-gravity-waves/B8C51A3FAEA72E6A0763CF3BC20DC5AA). The MATLAB scripts take video camera images of the ocean surface and estimate the $\Lambda(\textbf{c})$ omnidirectional and directional distributions (see below for an example of the directional distribution from Figure 14 in [Vrecica et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-21-0125.1)) along with the moments of the distribution which quantity white cap coverage and momentum flux due to wave breaking.

Video camera is a part of the Modular Aerial Sensing System (MASS), a compact airborne remote sensing instrument package developed by the Air-Sea Interactions Lab at SIO for observing surface and upper ocean processes (see [Melville et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0067.1) for more information).
