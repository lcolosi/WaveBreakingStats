Here, we provide the MATLAB code for computing wave-breaking statistics based on [Kliess and Melville (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1175/2010JTECHO744.1). The MATLAB scripts take video camera images of the ocean surface and estimate the $\Lambda(\textbf{c})$ omnidirectional and directional distributions (see figure below from [Vrecica et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-21-0125.1)) along with the moments of the distribution which quantity white cap coverage and momentum flux due to wave breaking.

Video camera is a part of the Modular Aerial Sensing System (MASS), a compact airborne remote sensing instrument package developed by the Air-Sea Interactions Lab at SIO for observing surface and upper ocean processes (see [Melville et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0067.1) for more information).
