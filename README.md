# Overview

Here, we provide the MATLAB code for computing wave breaking statistics based on the seminal work of Phillips 1986.
The MATLAB scripts take georeferenced video camera images of the ocean surface and estimate the lambda of c omnidirectional and directional distributions along with the moments of the distribution.

Video camera is apart of the Modular Aerial Sensing System (MASS), a compact airborne remote sensing instrument package developed by the Air-Sea Interactions Lab at SIO for observing surface and upper ocean processes (see Melville et al. 2016 for more information).
More specifically, the video camera is an IO Industries FLARE 12M125-CL camera with 4096 by 3072 pixel resolution, 10 bit, and  5-Hz sampling rate.
